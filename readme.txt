Import and manage a list of countries into your WordPress site as Custom Post Types.

== Description ==

Import and manage a list of countries into your WordPress site as Custom Post Types.

Each country has a ton of custom meta associated with it ranging from ISO country code to flag icons.

America and Canada have their respective cities included as Custom Meta too (however we're open to suggestions).

Essentially the goal for a Plugin like this is for it to become a core plugin that can be used by other plugins / plugin developers to wrangle and manage country related information. So for instance for the WP e-Commerce Plugin we can remove tables in the database that store country related information. And we can rely on WordPress to store that data instead. For BuddyPress we would like to see this Plugin being used to enhance BuddyPress Profiles - everybody comes from somewhere!!

== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file and uncompress it.
2. Put the "country" folder in "wp-content/plugins"
3. Enable in WordPress by visiting the "Plugins" menu and activating it.
4. To import default countries visit the Countries Importer in the admin.
